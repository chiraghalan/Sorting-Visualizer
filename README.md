```

📌 Sorting Algorithms Implemented

🔴 Bubble Sort
Worst-case Time Complexity: O(n²)
Best-case Time Complexity: O(n)
Stable Sort: ✅ Yes
How it Works?
Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
The largest element bubbles up to the end in each pass.
The process repeats until the array is fully sorted.

🟠 Quick Sort
Worst-case Time Complexity: O(n²)
Average-case Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Stable Sort: ❌ No
How it Works?
Selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two halves.
Recursively sorts each half until fully sorted.
Uses Divide & Conquer strategy.

🟡 Merge Sort
Worst-case Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Best-case Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Stable Sort: ✅ Yes
How it Works?
Divides the array into smaller subarrays until each contains a single element.
Merges the subarrays in sorted order.

🟢 Insertion Sort
Worst-case Time Complexity: O(n²)
Best-case Time Complexity: O(n)
Stable Sort: ✅ Yes
How it Works?
Builds the sorted array one element at a time.
Compares each element and places it in its correct position.

🎮 How to Use the Visualizer?
1️⃣ Select Sorting Algorithm: Click on one of the buttons (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)

2️⃣ Adjust Size & Speed: Use the sliders to modify the array size and sorting speed

3️⃣ Generate New Array: Click Refresh to create a new random array

4️⃣ Start Sorting: Press the selected sorting algorithm to watch the visualization!

🖼️ Screenshots
🔹 Main Interface
📌 Add a screenshot of the visualizer here

🔹 Sorting in Action
📌 Add a GIF or screenshot showing sorting steps

🏆 Why Use This Visualizer?
✅ Great for Learning: Helps students understand sorting algorithms with animations

✅ Intuitive UI: Easy-to-use interface with clean visuals

✅ No Dependencies: Works in any modern web browser

🚀 Future Improvements
Add more sorting algorithms (Heap Sort, Selection Sort)
Improve UI with better animations
Add a step-by-step mode for deeper understanding
