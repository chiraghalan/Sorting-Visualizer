# 🖥️ Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

![Sorting Visualizer](https://your-image-url.com/banner.png)

🚀 **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** is a **web-based tool** designed to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work **step by step** with **real-time animations**. Whether you are a beginner trying to learn sorting or an expert brushing up, this tool makes sorting **fun and interactive**!  

## 🎯 **Key Features**

✅ **Visualize Sorting Algorithms**
- 🔴 **Bubble Sort**  
- 🟠 **Quick Sort**  
- 🟢 **Merge Sort**  
- 🔵 **Insertion Sort**  
- 🟣 **Selection Sort** (Coming Soon)

✅ **Dynamic Array Generation**
- 🎲 Randomized array generation at the click of a button  
- 🎚️ Adjustable array **size**  
- ⏳ Adjustable **sorting speed**  

✅ **Real-time Sorting Animations**
- Color-coded bars:
  - 🔴 **Red** → Elements being compared  
  - 🟠 **Orange** → Elements being swapped  
  - 🟢 **Green** → Sorted elements  
  - 🔵 **Blue** → Default state  

✅ **Fully Responsive UI**
- Works on **desktops, tablets, and mobile devices** 📱💻

## 🛠️ **Technology Stack**

This project is built using:  

| Technology | Description |
|------------|------------|
| **HTML5** | Structuring the web page |
| **CSS3** | Styling & animations |
| **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Handling sorting logic & interactivity |
| **Bootstrap** | Responsive layout |
| **DOM Manipulation** | Creating visual animations |

## 🏗️ **How It Works? (Behind the Scenes)**

Each sorting algorithm follows a unique approach:  

🔹 **Bubble Sort** - Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.  
🔹 **Quick Sort** - Uses a **pivot** to divide and conquer the array.  
🔹 **Merge Sort** - Splits the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back.  
🔹 **Insertion Sort** - Builds a sorted array one element at a time.  

The **sorting visualizer** animates these steps by modifying the **DOM** in real-time, changing the height and color of bars to represent different stages of sorting.
